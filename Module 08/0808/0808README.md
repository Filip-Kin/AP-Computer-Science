* Description: Authentication object now with an array of User objects

## PMR
### Successes
- Honestly, this has grown into a disaster
### Failures
- Not really any quantitative data to analyze
- Random `Incorrect password` messages, so I just removed that print
- I know how to use objects.
I just don't think it's a good idea to practice them like this,
using objects for the sake of using objects
