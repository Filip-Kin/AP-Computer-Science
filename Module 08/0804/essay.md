I think climate models vary in how effective they are, but most of the models shown as examples appear to be accurate. These models have many possible scenarios simulated, depending on what the population does in the future. They climate models also use real temperature and general climate data from history, this increases the accuracy of the models. They can accurately predict what the future climate will look like depending on how much effort we put in.
Many people, even politicians, say that the computer generated forecasts cannot be trusted. But I say, the data can’t lie. In the United States climate change has become a “do you believe it or not” kind of thing, while in other parts of the world it is solid fact. The data we input into the computer models is accurate, so the computer’s analysis and output should also be accurate.

I believe that if we do not change our way of life, the damage on the environment will be irreversible. I live in Michigan, here the Michigan Climate Action Plan (CAP) was created by the Michigan Climate Action Council (MCAC). This plan provides greenhouse gas emissions inventory and forecasts, recommended emission reduction goals, and advice for state and local governments on measures to address climate change.

Message: I agree with you Nanditha, climate change is an issue on a global scale and there are many factors in it's recent increase. I think that computer models will help us understand what effects certain solutions will have on the problem.

Message: I agree with you that climate change is real, but many people would disagree. I also agree that government should not be totally responsible for fighting climate change, there are many things we can do as individuals to help the issue. I can't wait to see what quantum computing can do for us in the future.
