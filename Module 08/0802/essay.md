# Programming Style Comparison
When programming, there are many ways to accomplish the same task.
This is where programmers differentiate themselves from the rest.
Beyond syntax styles, there is styling the division of logic.
Many will argue whether the method signature and opening bracket should be on separate lines or together,
which they totally should be on the same line. 
Syntax can be automatically changed to suit your style,
the division of logic is set once the program is written.
Often you can't change it without completely rewriting the program.

The first programming style shown is called procedural programming.
All the functionality of the program is contained in one method, in one class.
Many first time programmers will learn the basics in a language such as JavaScript or Python which is focused on procedural programming.
This style of programming is very easy to follow since it just runs from top to bottom.
However, one downside to this is that you're missing out on all the benefits of functions and classes.

The second programming style shown is called functional programming.
While it still includes aspects procedural programming,
the program isn't necessarily locked into going from top to bottom.
Functions allow the programmer to save time and file size by saving a code snippet to be used many times over and over again.
Another feature of functions is that you can input different variables for each run of the function.

The last programming style shown is called object orientated programming.
This has all the features of the other two while also introducing objects.
Objects allow you to store data more efficiently in memory and is more modular.
The downside to this style is that learning it can be quite a challenge for new programmers.

My favorite style of programming is a hybrid of functional and object orientated programming.
While I don't love using objects for everything, it often simplifies tasks.
I mostly use objects for storing data because I can have variable names, nested objects and different types in one array.
