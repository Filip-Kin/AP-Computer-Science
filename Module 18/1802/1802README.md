* Description: Tests the Music class using a sequential search

## PMR
### Successes
- Stole my Sort class from 1705, saved me like 30 minutes cause all I had to do was run a find and replace `Item` for `Music` and change the compare method
- I really like my solutions to the search in this assignment
### Failures
- Had to switch to arraylist
39 minutes
