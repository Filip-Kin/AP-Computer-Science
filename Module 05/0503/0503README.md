## PMR
### Successes
- I used a switch instead of if statements
### Failures
- The data had empty lines, when I had if statements the 1 boy and 1 girl was just the default if the family wasn't 
BB GG it was BG or GB which are counted the same way, except there were those empty lines so it could have been GB BG or just a blank space
