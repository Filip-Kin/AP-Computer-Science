###Successes
- Didn't plan or test, worked first try only need a few adjustments to print statements to make output look better
- Stress tested with 1,000,000,000 trials. We're 7 minutes in and have a 3GB file which won't open... so this may take a while, but I really want that super accurate average. Really this is a stress test of my SSD.
### Failures
- I didn't plan anything out, didn't write pseudocode, didn't need to, don't care, i forfeit my 2 points
- Yeah I went back to my usual style of programming, which is confusing variable names, no planning, but it's a lot faster and more fun.
- If I actually cared about this program I would add a live updating counter while it runs trials and an ability to press a key and cancel the trials and just run the statistics immedietly
