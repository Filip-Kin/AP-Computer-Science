Pathways to Computer Science: In what ways do the people in this video correspond to or differ from your image of a computer scientist?
- Computer science is having “some knowledge of how to solve problems, essentially.” I agree with this because when your programming you're really just teaching the computer how to solve a problem. However, not all problems are as important as others. For example, the people in this video are finding ways around actual problems. I write programs because I'm lazy, I wrote a Discord bot that converts NZD to USD and vice versa so when I'm talking to my friend from New Zealand. All I have to say is !nzdusd $99.99 in the chat, no need to open Google and type 99.99 nzd to usd.

What common themes do they express that inspires their work?
- They say that Computer Science is a tool for solving problems and focus on helping people. Whether it was predicting the forecast or assisting in medical studies. everyone in the video was proud of how they're helped people.

In what ways has their knowledge of computer science enabled them to more successfully pursue their interests and careers?
-The Microsoft Researcher in India said that he wanted to help people in rural areas and using the power of computers has been able to collect information about Indian Education to better know how to help.

In what ways is computer science affecting a field you are interested in pursuing?
- I want to be some sort of computer technician, so like the field exists because of computer science.

How could you combine computer science and your fields of interest to chart a unique path for your future?
- It wouldn't be very unique but write programs to assist me in doing my job? I guess if for example I continued running my business of retrofitting old Dell Optiplexes with graphics cards, I might write a Linux distro specifically designed to run some diagnostics on the computer before selling it.

Message: I agree, I always thought computer science was limited to working in the tech industry while in reality computer scientists are needed everywhere. People are lazy and computers can automate annoying tedious tasks like data collection. They're also more accurate than humans for these tasks.

Computers can solve a lot of problems that modern medicine cannot solve naturally. I personally can't wait until we can embed chip in our brains so we can run complex math calculations super fast, and maybe even have an internet connection. If we had access to Google through that a world of information would no longer be at your fingertips, because now it's embedded in your brain. All you need to do is wonder "how does this work" and then the modded Google Lens app in your brain sees what you see, looks it up, and explains it to you. Also, the NSA would probably have unlimited access to all the contents of your brain, and if the chip was manufactured in China it'll be constantly phoning home with your information. Still, would be cool.
