## PMR
### Successes
- This assignment was extremely easy, like even more so than how easy it's supposed to be. I already use the same name for instance and local variables in a lot of my code. All I had to do was open my main CS folder in VS Code, and use the search tab to find all instances of `this.` and then copy pasted 2 of the projects into this src folder.
### Failures
- I see no problems
