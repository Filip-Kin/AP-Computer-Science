* Description: Sorts an ArrayList of MovieV3 objects

## PMR
### Successes
- I could reuse the majority of my old code, and this sorting algorithum was much easier to implement. Only worked on it for 18 minutes
### Failures
- I'm not sure if creating a new array is cheating? am I supposed to only use the array originally provided? I had to make a copy of the original array so that it wouldn't be destroyed, I could've probably also just done movies = newList at the end or something.
