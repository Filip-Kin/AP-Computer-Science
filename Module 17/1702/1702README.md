* Description: Sorts an ArrayList of movies

## PMR
### Successes
- It works! and I got to use my debugger again to figure out what was going on
- I made a single method that actually did all the sorting because it was easier
### Failures
- It took me over an hour to do, which is the longest I've ever worked on a single assignment since I've install the time tracking plugin to my IDE
My top 5:
1 hr 2 mins	...7/1702/src/MovieTester.java 
32 mins	...src/FrequencyAnalyzer.java 
28 mins	...4/1403/src/CaesarTester.java 
27 mins	...pixLab/classes/Picture.java 
27 mins	...4/1403/src/Encryption.java 
Total of 10 hours and 53 minutes across all files in my APCS folder

It took a while, but it was not hard. I ran it for the first time probably 40 minutes in and only had to change a few condition statements to correct my logic
