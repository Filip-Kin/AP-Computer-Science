## PMR
### Successes
- `The merge sort will sort only in ascending order.` Me: *Laughs in reverse*
- Separate sorting class cause reusability
### Failures
- I had to rewrite my insert sort algorithm a little bit so that it would work with the universal compare method

This assignment reminded me of a program I wrote 2 years ago in a 101 Java class, and I didn't know how to use objects and it was really ugly but pretty advanced for gluing together stuff from StackOverflow https://github.com/Filip9696/RetailManager
