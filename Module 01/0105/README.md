## PMR
### Successes
- Making the banner was a little difficult but I figured it out
- A mixture of `print` and `println` was used
- I used `\n` in large print statement to use effectively write multiple lines off of only 1 print statement
### Failures
- At first I thought println places the new line at the beginning of the string so I put those on the labels instead of the values
- I had a difficult time making the age calculating code because I'm used to just doing `new Date('2003-01-10')` in JavaScript, but in Java you need to parse the string according to a predefined format
