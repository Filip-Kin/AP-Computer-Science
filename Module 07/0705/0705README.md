* Description: Estimate pi by throwing darts at a circle

## PMR
### Successes
- I love this line `if (dartThrow()) hits++;`
- Closest trial was `Trial 47 pi = 3.14159192` after throwing 1 billion darts
### Failures
- I hate how I have to make an array if I want to return 2 individual values from a function `return new int[] {a,b};`
